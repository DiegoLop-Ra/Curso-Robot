# EXERCISE 21:
## REVISITING TEARDOWN (40 MINS):
### AGENDA:
1. Concept (15 min)
   - Data cleanup and teardowns
2. Challenge
   - Clean up the data created in Invoices by the test.
     - Hint: Teardown and "Run Keywords" pair nicely.
     - "Set Suite Variable" will be key to use ${invoiceNumber} in the teardown

### EXTRA CREDIT:
- Decide what a "known state" of the application would be for tests.
- Set the application to a known state for tests to work.

### DEBRIEF (10 MINS):
- When should you clean up data?
  - Is the end of the test the best place to do that?
