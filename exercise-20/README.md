# EXCERCISE 20:
## REVISITING ASSERTIONS (45 MINS):
### PURPROSE:
Learn how to create dynamic expectations for assertions.

### AGENDA:
1. Introduction to the creation of verification point assertions. (15 mins)
   - How do we know if the test is currently on the correct page?
2. Challenge (15 mins):
   - Verify the Invoice we created shows up on the next page.

### CHALLENGE (15 MINS):
Verify the invoice we created shows up on the next page.

### DEBRIEF (15 MINS):
- Did we just finish our first test?
  - Why not? What's missing?
- Does the UI validation we implemented actually mean the invoice was created?
- What happens if we have duplicate invoices?
- What happens if you tweak the assertion to check for a non existent invoice?
  - Why does this verification take so long to fail?
