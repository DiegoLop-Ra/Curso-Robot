# EXERCISE 05
## TEST CASES
### PURPOSE:
The purpose of this exercise is learn what a test case is in RobotFramework.

### AGENDA (30 MIN):
1. Concepts (15 min):
  - What is a test case?
  - How do you expect an automated test case to be different than an automated one?
  - Can you automate testing?
2. Syntax
3. Naming
4. Format (Arrange, Act, Assert)
5. Review tour-of.robot to see an example of a RobotFramework test case.

### CHALLENGE (15 MIN):
Verify that "Invoice Manager" is on the first page of the application.

### EXTRA CREDIT:
Set up additional verification points to make sure that the page is the correct page.

### DEBRIEF (15 min):
- What are your thoughts about the example test case from this exercise?
  - Is it a "good" test case? Think about why or why not.

### NOTES:
- [RobotFramework Test Case Syntax](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-case-syntax)
- “Although Given-When-Then style is symptomatic to BDD, the basic idea is pretty common when writing tests or specification by example. Meszaros describes the pattern as Four-Phase Test. His four phases are Setup (Given), Exercise (When), Verify (Then) and Teardown [5]. Bill Wake came up with the formulation as Arrange, Act, Assert.”
