### NOTES:
- [RobotFramework Test Case Syntax](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-case-syntax)
- “Although Given-When-Then style is symptomatic to BDD, the basic idea is pretty common when writing tests or specification by example. Meszaros describes the pattern as Four-Phase Test. His four phases are Setup (Given), Exercise (When), Verify (Then) and Teardown [5]. Bill Wake came up with the formulation as Arrange, Act, Assert.”
