### DEBRIEF (5 MIN):
- When would we want to externalize variables?
- Are there instances when you would want to use one method over the other?
- Any downsides to user provided variables?
  - When couldn't you use them?
- What do you think would be a well named variable?
  - What about a poorly named variable? Why?
