# EXERCISE 07
## TEST SUITE SETUP (25 MIN):
### PURPOSE:
The purpose of this exercise is to learn how setup is done for a test suite in RobotFramework.

### AGENDA:
1. Introduce concept of setup (15 min)
  - Arrange, Act, Assert pattern continued
    - How do we arrange?
      - "Arrange" is the suite set up
    - Also "Test Setup"
2. Challenge (5 min):
  - Manage test suite set up by calling an existing keyword.

### EXTRA CREDIT:
Create a second test and call the comment keyword at the beginning of each test case using a concept similar to suite setup.

### DEBRIEF (5 MIN):
- What are other things might we do before starting testing?
- How is this different from testing an application manually?
  - Is there a substantial difference?
- In addition to setting up a test via a setup, what might we do after a test has completed?
