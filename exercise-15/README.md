# EXERCISE 15
## CLICKING ELEMENTS (45 MIN):
### PURPOSE:
Introduce the SeleniumLibrary and clicking on elements.

### AGENDA:
1. [SeleniumLibrary documentation](http://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html) (15 min):
  - What keyword would allow for clicking a link?
2. The goal of the test case from "tour-of.robot" is to add an invoice and make sure it was added.
3. Challenge (15 min):
  - Split into groups of 3 and try and write next test step to click “add invoice”

### EXTRA CREDIT:
- Slow the test down to see that the add invoice is clicked.
- Use RobotFramework to prove to yourself that the add invoice link was clicked.

### DEBRIEF (15 MIN):
- How else can be identify this element?
- How do we know when we are on the desired page?
- Can the test perform this sort of verification?
