# EXERCISE 35:
## PYTHON - IMPORTING LOCAL LIBRARIES:
### PURPOSE:
Introduce users to using Local Libraries using RobotFramework.

### AGENDA:
1. Discussing external libraries (15 mins):
   - What are they and how do you import them.
2. Run test case to demonstrate that addition is working from imported library (5 mins).
3. Add test cases to verify subtraction and multiplication are working (15 mins).

### CHALLENGE:
- Add python code to perform division.
  - Add a test case to verify that it works.
- Add python code to perform modulus arithmetic.
  - Modulus is the remainder of two inputs
  - Add a test case to verify that it works.

### DEBRIEF:
- Why would we want to use a local library?
- How are local libraries similar to external libraries?
- When should you use a library or implement a library?
  - In what cases should you use a keyword instead?
- What are the downsides to using a local library?
  - What are the downsides to implementing your own library?
